a project that started during advent of code 2020, and was forgotten after that.. But I think other people might enjoy this hacky plugin for vim.

A lot of work is needed, mainly in cleaning & sanitizing the code. This  was written in a quite big rush, as there was new challenge to be solved with advent of code every day, this came to be a handy tool to help with creating pure-bash solutions.



about the project.. to be written here when I have time & energy, but asciinema recording will explain better than thousand words.
