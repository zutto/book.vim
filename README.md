Book is a neovim plugin, written in lua.

Execute snippets within lua, just by inserting a shebang line under your code. (see asciinema recording below)

a project that started during advent of code 2020, and was forgotten after that.. But I think other people might enjoy this hacky plugin for neovim.

A lot of work is needed, mainly in cleaning & sanitizing the code, fixing some bugs (and finding more bugs, I am sure this has plenty, my luafoo is not great). This  was written in a quite big rush, as there was new challenge to be solved with advent of code every day, this came to be a handy tool to help with creating pure-bash solutions.



about the project.. to be written here when I have time & energy, but asciinema recording will explain better than thousand words.
